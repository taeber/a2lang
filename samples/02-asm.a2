; This is how you inline 6502 assembly
; Oh and comments start with semi-colons!

asm {
CH      EQU $26
COUT    EQU $FDED
* Don't forget about comments!
main:   LDA #10
        STA CH    * And these comments, too.
        JMP $3D0

MSG     ASC "Oh, hai."
        HEX 8D00

And really, you can put anything in here as it's copied verbatim to the output
for use by the assembler.
