A2: A Programming Language for the Apple II
===========================================

A2 is a programming language targeting the MOS 6502 computer architecture of
the Apple II computer. It is more higher-level than 6502 assembly, but not as
high-level as C.

Here's a sample:

```
; hello.a2

asm {
	ORG $800
	JSR main
	JMP $3D0
}

use [
    COUT : sub <- [ch: char @ A] @ $FDED
    CROUT: sub @ $FD8E
]

var PTR: word @ $06

let Println = sub <- [txt: text @ PTR] {
    var i: int @ Y
    i := 0
    while txt_i <> 0 {
        COUT(txt_i)
        i  += 1
    }
    CROUT()
}

let main = sub {
    Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

Here are [more samples](samples/) which are also being used to test compilation.

thing. And if you *are* into that kind of thing, check out my

## Quickstart

```
$ git clone https://github.com/taeber/a2lang
$ cd a2lang
$ edit hello.a2
$ ./a2 build hello.a2
$ ./a2 run
# Opens an Apple II emulator. Load the build/DISK.DSK disk image, then run:
]BRUN PROG
```

## Types

The language provides very few data types.
The three fundamental types are `byte`, `char`, and `word`.
* `byte` is simply an 8-bit value.
* `word` is a 16-bit, little-endian, unsigned value.
* `char` is also 8-bit, like `byte`, but it logically represents a single ASCII
character.

In addition, there are composite types that allow for collections of both
homogeneous (`array`) and heterogeneous (`group`) items.

```
; Comments start with a semi-colon.

var scores: byte^10  ; array of 10 bytes

; Define a new group called Point3D
let Point3D = [
    X: byte  ; Like Go, commas are required by the grammar
    Y: byte  ; but the compiler accepts a new line as well.
    Z: byte
]

var points: Point3D
```

There are also pointers to memory locations, but unlike other languages and
specifically because of the limitations of the 6502, their locations must be
known at compile-time and they must reside in the Zero Page.

Some of the You can also define new types

## Control Flow

A2 also provides conditional checks (`if`) and looping (`while`), but only one
kind for each.
There are **no** `for`-loops, `do`-loops, `else`, or `switch`
statements.
Inspiration was taken from Go when considering what not to include
in the language.
Comparisons always require two arguments and, with the exception of `<>` for
*not equals*, are operators are C-like.

## Subroutines (Functions)

The 6502 has builtin support for subroutines using the `JSR` (Jump to
Subroutine) and `RTS` (Return from Subroutine), however, it doesn't support
parameters in the programming language sense of the word. A2 adds support for
parameters of both input and output variety.

```
; Println writes the NUL-terminated msg pointed at by PTR along with a carriage
; return and outputs the number of characters written, n.
use Println: sub
    <- [msg: char^ @ PTR]
    -> [n: byte]
```

It is vital to note that local variables (including arguments) do not have
automatic storage like in C. This means that recursion is not generally
supported; rather, it can be done, but you have to manage your own stack.
This was done to make it easier to access locals when writing inline assembly.
If implementing a subroutine in assembly, you can access the return value by
using its qualified name, such as in: `LDA Println.n`.
Furthermore, the 6502 stack is hardwired to be the First Page and is therefore
only 256 bytes, so the recursion depth would be seriously limited.

## Arithmetic

Perhaps the most tedious aspect of A2, relative to higher-level languages, is
basic arithmetic. A2 does not support complex statements; you must split these
up

```
; Most languages: Z = 42 + B - C
; A2 be like:
Z := 42
Z += B
Z -= C
```

This is because the 6502 has a single register that supports arithmetic
operations, the Accumulator. Therefore, the language makes the user be explicit
about where they are loading and storing values from so as to pick the
appropriate addressing mode.

## Adding type information

Inspired by TypeScript, the language started out as a markup for 6502 assembly.
This can be seen in subroutine declarations. Take the Apple II ROM subroutine
`PRNTAX` found at `$F941`. It "Prints A-Reg as Two-Digit Hex Number" followed
by X. This is declared in A2 as: `use PRNTAX: sub <- [val: word @ AX] @ $F941`.
It can then be called like: `PRNTAX($BEAD)`.


## Omitted Features

Like C, the language provides no facilities for input and output, no storage
allocation facilities, no heap, and no garbage collection. The expectation is
that there already exists routines for the system that need only be declared
and called by the A2 program.

## Benefits

Why would you use this language? I hope that it's quicker to write software
for the Apple II (and maybe other 6502-based machines like the Commander X16)
than writing in pure assembly, but that it also allows for super easy
integration with assembly when its needed.


### A note about the character type

On most systems, `byte` and `char` are essentially equivalent, but the Apple II
line of computers uses what is often called "High-ASCII" since the 8th-bit
needs to be set for a character to display normally in Apple II Text Mode.
In ASCII, an uppercase A is `$41` in hexadecimal, but in High-ASCII,
it is $C1.

Currently, the compiler treats the two types as a `byte`, but does output text
and character literals in High-ASCII.

## More details about the Sample

```
; hello.a2

; Inline 6502 assembly is supported within an asm-block.
; 1. ORG $800 directs the assembler to assume the code will run from $800.
; 2. Calls our main subroutine.
; 3. After returning from main, control is given back to DOS.
asm {
	ORG $800
	JSR main
	JMP $3D0
}

; Add type information to builtin, Apple II ROM subroutines.
use [
    ; COUT, the Character Output routine, prints out ch.
    ; Note: @ A means the argument should be passed in using the accumulator
    ; and @ $FDED is the fixed location of the routine in memory.
    COUT : sub <- [ch: char @ A] @ $FDED
    ; CROUT prints a carriage return.
    CROUT: sub @ $FD8E
]

; PTR will be used as a pointer, so it must live in Zero Page.
var PTR: word @ $06

; Println writes the NUL-terminated msg pointed at by PTR along with a CR.
; Note: text is a builtin alias to char^.
let Println = sub <- [txt: text @ PTR] {
    var i: int @ Y
    i := 0
    while txt_i <> 0 {
        COUT(txt_i)
        i  += 1
    }
    CROUT()
}

let main = sub {
    Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

### Tips

Since the compiler (`./compile`) only translates A2 code into 6502 assembly, an
assembler is still needed convert that into machine binary. I've included the
`a2` bash script to make it less painful. That script will download [`a2asm`][]
from GitHub, build it, and run it.

[`a2asm`]: https://github.com/taeber/a2asm

Anyway, you can add an `a2` alias with tab completion for Bash by running:
```
$ eval $(./a2 bash)
$ a2 help
```

### Bugs

Bugs? Yeah. It's buggy. I very quickly ran out of time for this passion project.
Feel free to file a GitHub issue. Or, you know, sponser me to work on it full
time and I'll find all the bugs for you! ;-]
